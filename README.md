## Trouble with Goodtime getting killed by Android?
Different phone [OEMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer) (phone vendors) have an aggressive take towards apps that rely on background work and alarms to save some battery life.
It is recommended that you disable the battery optimization for this app in order to get accurate alarms.
In the worst case, if you still have issues, try to keep the phone plugged in and/or the screen on while working.
